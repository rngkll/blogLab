The omnipresence of technology nowadays has made it commonplace to read news about AI, just a quick glance at today's headlines, and I get:
- [This Powerful AI Technique Led to Clashes at Google and Fierce Debate in Tech.](https://www.morningbrew.com/emerging-tech/stories/2021/03/29/one-biggest-advancements-ai-also-sparked-fierce-debate-heres?utm_source=morning_brew)
- [How A.I.-powered companies dodged the worst damage from COVID](https://fortune.com/2021/04/02/ai-forecasting-supply-chain-factories-caterpillar-agco/)
- [AI technology detects ‘ticking time bomb’ arteries](https://www.mobihealthnews.com/news/emea/ai-technology-detects-ticking-time-bomb-arteries)
- [AI in Drug Discovery Starts to Live Up to the Hype](https://www.genengnews.com/insights/ai-in-drug-discovery-starts-to-live-up-to-the-hype/)
- [Pentagon seeks commercial solutions to get its data ready for AI](https://www.c4isrnet.com/artificial-intelligence/2021/04/02/pentagon-seeks-commercial-solutions-to-get-its-data-ready-for-ai/)
  

Topics from business, manufacturing, supply chain, medicine and biotech and even defense are covered in those news headlines, definitively the advancements on the fields of artificial intelligence, in particular machine learning and deep neural networks have permeated into our daily lives and are here to stay. But, do the general population know what are we talking about when we say "an AI"?  I assume most people correctly imagine a computer algorithm or perhaps the more adventurous minds think of a physical machine, an advanced computer entity or even a robot, getting smarter by itself with every use-case we throw at it. And most people will be right, when "an AI" is mentioned it is indeed an algorithm run by a computer, and there is where the boundary of their knowledge lies. 

They say that the best way to learn something is to try to explain it, so in a personal exercise I will try to do an ELI5 (**E**xplain it **L**ike **I** am **5**) version of what is a neural network.

Let's start with a little history, humans have been tinkering with the idea of an intelligent machine for a while now, some even say that the idea of artificial intelligence was conceived by the ancient greeks ([source](https://www.thinkautomation.com/bots-and-ai/a-history-of-automation-the-rise-of-robots-and-ai/)), and several attempts at devising "intelligent" machines have been made through history, a notable one was 'The Analytical Engine' created by Charles Babbage in 1837:
